# (De)Coupling

 * Low coupling as goal in programming
 * Ways of achievement
 * All direct calls create some sort of coupling, thus yielding systems rigid and brittle
 * Event-based systems allow a high degree of decoupling (at the expense of traceability)
 * Also, one of the tenets of microservices (therefore, we spot decoupling tendencies at various levels)
 * Also, DDD
 * Also, JAMstack
 * So, it's not that we're artificially associating trends but rather, we're converging towards an essence and we're solving the same problem at different levels of the stack
 * It poses problems up-front that seem to evolve faster
 * Ultimately, think of Unix
